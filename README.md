# Todo

- [x] Twitch private client ID: get Twitch private API token(id) via web driver.
- [x] Twitch channel status: get Twitch channel status via API.
- [x] Twitch accesstoken: get Twitch accesstoken via API.
- [x] Twitch stream m3u8: get the metadata of the channel streams.
- [ ] Twitch stream m3u8 for specific qualify: automatically parse the related m3u8 playlists.

# Development

If you want to dive into the function definitions, go [API](#api) section to see deeply.

## Environment

I have developed this application in following environment:

- Node.JS v10.20.1 (via NVM)
- Windows 10 x64 Pro 19H1
- Atom-Editor
- Standard.JS

## Code styles

There is some rules that I personally keep in mind.

1. ESlint
  - Use [Standard.JS](https://standardjs.com/).
  - We may disable some rules as we need but keep if it is not essential.

2. Personal rules
  - Use 2 spaces as tab.
  - Don't use semicolon unless it is **really** required.
  - Don't use NPM instead of Yarnpkg. (Don't create the lock file of NPM)
  - Use [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) package as logging package. (It isn't native module)
  - Don't use `import` or `require` keyword together and make a collection of `import` or `require` as the type of module(local(`./`) or dependency(or global module)).

## Installation

If you want to start the development of this application, just install dependencies!
Developing Node.JS application is not that hard to start.

```bash
yarn
```

- I prefer and use [Yarnpkg](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) personally. Also, NPM will work well, but if you want to maximize the compatibility via lock file, install it.

## Testing

First of all, I don't use any testing utility as you can see.
Instead of, I included `.test.js` files to see how the specific function works.

- Also, I don't prefer TypeScript. Personally, use [deepscan.io](https://deepscan.io) to inspect the bugs at the development time.

# API

If you want to use this application as module, you can hack it via installing from GitHub!

## Installation

You can install this package via Yarnpkg.

```bash
yarn add https://github.com/Seia-Soto/twitchArc
```

If you want to use NPM.

```bash
npm i Seia-Soto/twitchArc
```

### Accessing the specific function

I personally locate the core functions in [`/structures`](/structures) folder and create the `index.js` file to use easily from anywhere.
So, you can import specific function you want via following way.

```javascript
// NOTE: Require `/structures` directly.
const {
  twitch: {
    getPrivateToken
  }
} = require('Seia-Soto/twitchArc/structures')
```

## Documentation

### structures/twitch/getPrivateToken

Get the private token(client id) from Twitch web app via playwright(web driver, see [microsoft/playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)).

- arguments
  - opts \<Object\> (optional)
    - domain \<String\>: `twitch.tv`
    - timeout \<Number\>: 15 * 1000
- returns
  - <Promise: Object>
    - clientID: <String> (optional)
    - error: <Error> (optional)

```js
const {
  twitch: {
    getPrivateToken
  }
} = require('Seia-Soto/twitchArc/structures')

getPrivateToken()
  .then(({ clientID = 'No client ID detected!' }) => console.log(clientID))
```

#### Notes

- Getting client ID from Twitch web app.

Twitch uses client ID to determine the API requester and changed the private API requesting method to use client ID forcibly.
As a result, we need to crawl it if we don't want to update the static client ID every time it changes.
In `network` tab of web browser development tools, we can see the request which ends with `/access_token` and that request should include the client id in its `Client-ID` header.
How simple it is?
Also, it is not that difficult because there is a lot of web driver library.
In this time, I selected the `playwright` project from Microsoft as web driver library to control web browser.

- Determining when we should stop crawling.

To determine when is the end of page load, we cannot use events such as `load` or `documentloaded` because Twitch web app is React.JS app.
React.JS as front-end library which builds the website via JavaScript, we cannot stop the checking requests with `documentloaded`.
Also, about `load` event, since Twitch is streaming website, the request will be created continuously unless we close the tab.
So, instead of using event listeners, I have decided to use timer.

### structures/twitch/getChannelStatus

Get the status of the channel including stream information via Twitch GQL api.

- arguments
  - opts \<Object\>
    - gqlURL \<String\>: `https://gql.twitch.tv/gql` (optional)
    - username \<String\>
    - clientID \<String\>
- returns
  - \<Promise: Object\>
    - user \<Object\> (optional)
      - stream \<Object\> (optional)

If you want to see the what actually you can get, please refer the Graph QL query in the source code.

```js
const {
  twitch: {
    getChannelStatus
  }
} = require('Seia-Soto/twitchArc/structures')

getChannelStatus({ clientID: 'kimne78kx3ncx6brgo4mv6wki5h1ko', username: 'fluentAroma' })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

#### Notes

- About Twitch unofficial GQL API.

You may find the `/gql` XHR requests in the network tab of the web browser developer tools.
Yes, it is Graph QL API endpoint of Twitch.
The official GQL API of Twitch was not introduced in public, so I used some awesome tools to build the query. (The current query content is from the following repository because I googled about it after the discovery: [mauricew/twitch-graphql-api](https://github.com/mauricew/twitch-graphql-api))
To dig additional information of the private GQL API of Twitch, I used [Insomnia REST API Client](https://insomnia.rest/) which is really powerful and easy to use.
The Insomnia recognized the GQL API endpoint and automatically crawled the documentation for me.
Isn't it really comfortable even this is included in official GQL specification?

- Check the status of user.

If you want to check if the user is exists and is streaming, just `null` check the returning payload.

### structures/twitch/getAccessToken

Get the accesstoken via the official Twitch API and client ID.

- arguments
  - opts \<Object\>
    - apiURL \<String\>: `https://api.twitch.tv` (optional)
    - username \<String\>
    - clientID \<String\>
    - clientOpts \<Object\> (optional)
      - oauth_token \<String\>:
      - need_https \<Boolean\>: true
      - platform \<String\>: _
      - player_type \<String\>: site
      - player_backend \<String\>: mediaplayer
- returns
  - \<Promise: Object\>
    - sig \<String\>
    - token \<String\>
    - mobile_restricted \<Boolean\>
    - expires_at \<String: datetime\>

```js
const {
  twitch: {
    getAccessToken
  }
} = require('Seia-Soto/twitchArc/structures')

getAccessToken({ clientID: 'kimne78kx3ncx6brgo4mv6wki5h1ko', username: 'fluentAroma' })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

#### Notes

- Getting private accesstoken.

To access the contents of the live stream or the channel, the accesstoken is required.
In this project, I have coded the logic to dig the Twitch's official client ID for the web application.
So, in this logic, I have decided to use the client ID from the Twitch.
Also, Twitch won't allow you to save the content of the live stream, so you have to use the Twitch's private client ID for it.

> TODO: Add more information about the accesstoken output data.

### structures/twitch/getChannelM3U8

        - mediaSequence \<Number\>
        - dateTimeString \<String\>
        - dateTimeObject \<Datetime\>
        - discontinuitySequence \<Number\>: `0`
      - raw \<Object: M3U8Parser.manifest\>

```js
const {
  twitch: {
    getAccessToken,
    getChannelM3U8
  }
} = require('Seia-Soto/twitchArc/structures')

const username = 'fluentAroma'

getAccessToken({ clientID: 'kimne78kx3ncx6brgo4mv6wki5h1ko', username })
  .then(data => data)
  .then(({ sig, token }) => getChannelM3U8({
    username,
    token,
    sig
  }))
  .then(m3u8 => console.log(m3u8))
```

#### Notes

- What is fast_bread mode?

When you're watch Twitch, if you want to reduce the delay between the streamer, you can enable fast bread mode for fast update of each part of stream output in `ts` file.
However, these fast bread mode highly depends on your network status and the output video can be corrupted if your network is too weak to handle the multiple stream downloads.
